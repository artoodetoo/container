# Container
Yet another service container

Container **DOES NOT** use reflection and type hint information in any form.

## Features
Container keep two kind of values: services and parameters.

Service will instantiated when you call call it by name. _Usually_ service is object type, but not nesessary. Mind it as
"product" of some routine.

Methods: `get()` and `set()`.

Parameters are not instantiating, they just stored and retrieved.

Methods: `getParameter()` and `setParameter()`.

## Install

To install with composer:

```sh
composer require artoodetoo/container
```

## Basic Usage

### Configuration
There are special configuraton sections:

- root used to store basic values, which can be substituted into service definition.
- `shared` node defines shared services. after it created once it can be retrieved many times.
- `multiple` node defines new instance created on every get() call

In other sections you can store any kind of information and retrieve it in dot notation (see below).

### Simple service definition
```php
use R2\DependencyInjection\Container;

$config = [
  'shared' => [
    'view' => R2\Templating\Dirk::class
  ]
];
$c = new Container($config);
$c->get('view')->render('index');
```

### Parameters substitution
```php
$config = [
  'ROOT'   => '\var\www\mysite',
  'PUBLIC' => '\var\www\mysite\public',
  'shared' => [
    'view' => [
      'class' => R2\Templating\Dirk::class,
      'options' => [
          'views' => '%ROOT%/views',
          'cache' => '%ROOT%/cache',
      ],
      ...
  ]
];
...
$c->get('view')->render('index');
```

### Factory method
```php
$config = [
  'shared' => [
    'userManager' => App\UserManager::class,
    'user' => '@userManager:getCurrentUser',
    ...
  ]
]
...
echo $c->get('user')->username;
```

### Container injection
There are two ways to inject container into service instance:  
1. Add interface `R2\DependencyInjection\ContainerAwareInterface` to service class
  and define setContainer() method.
2. Substitute container in constructor parameters. It is special name `CONTAINER`:  
```php
$config = [
  'shared' => [
    'example' => [
        'class' => Example::class,
        'container' => '%CONTAINER%',
    ],
  ]
];
```

### Parameters and dot notation:
```php
$config = [
  'options' => [
    'cookie' => [
      'name' => 'the-cookie',
      'domain' => '.example.com'
    ]
];
...
setcookie(
  $c->getParameter('options.cookie.name'),
  $value,
  0,
  '/',
  $c->getParameter('options.cookie.domain')
);

```

### Notes and Limits

Any part of configuration can be read by getParameter, including special sections `shared` and `multiple`.

As for now, substitution patterns work in service production only.

Only parameters from config root can be used in substitution patterns.
